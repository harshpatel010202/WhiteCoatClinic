Why use Docker?
--> Docker allows developers to create isolated containers to deploy applications faster.
    Furthermore, Docker helps in replicating a production like environment to ensure that
    the program does not give trouble during release to production.


Why use Jira integrated with our GitHub repository?
--> Jira allows developers to connect their GitHub Repository with Jira so developers can do following:
    1. In Jira, developers can create a task ticket for them to work on to make the process of development visible throughout the team.
    2. Also, Jira can create an automated branch name for each ticket so developers can use such name.
    3. Jira makes development easier since each developer can observe their team progress.
